# 🚀 **Quick Deploy Guide - Get Live in 10 Minutes!**

Your Bucket List Tracker is ready to deploy! Choose your deployment method:

## 🎯 **Method 1: GitHub + Amplify (Recommended - FREE)**

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it: `bucket-list-tracker`
3. Make it **Public** (required for free tier)
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### Step 2: Push Your Code
```powershell
# Add your GitHub repository URL (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bucket-list-tracker.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy to AWS Amplify
1. Go to [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
2. Click **"New app"** → **"Host web app"**
3. Choose **"GitHub"** and authorize AWS access
4. Select your `bucket-list-tracker` repository
5. Choose `main` branch
6. **Build settings** (Amplify will auto-detect, but verify):
   ```yaml
   version: 1
   frontend:
     phases:
       preBuild:
         commands:
           - npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline
       build:
         commands:
           - npm run build
     artifacts:
       baseDirectory: dist
       files:
         - '**/*'
     cache:
       paths:
         - node_modules/**/*
         - .npm/**/*
   ```
7. Click **"Save and deploy"**

### Step 4: Your App is LIVE! 🎉
