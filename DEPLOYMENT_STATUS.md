- **Impact**: Enables proper Amplify Gen 2 pipeline deployment

#### 2. Added TypeScript Support

- **Added**: `tsconfig.json` for proper compilation
- **Impact**: Supports TypeScript backend files compilation

#### 3. Enhanced amplify.yml Configuration
- **Added**: Verification step for `ampx` command
- **Improved**: Better error handling in build process
- **Added**: Clear comments for each build step

#### 4. Added Helpful Scripts
```json
{
  "ampx:configure": "npx ampx configure",
  "ampx:deploy": "npx ampx pipeline-deploy",
  "ampx:sandbox": "npx ampx sandbox"
}
```
