# Deployment Status

## Latest Deployment: Simplified Build Configuration

**Date**: August 9, 2025  
**Status**: üîÑ Updated Strategy - Frontend First  
**Branch**: main  

### Issue Analysis

#### Root Cause of Build Cancellations
- **Problem**: Backend build phase was timing out or failing
- **Observation**: Deployments were getting cancelled during Node.js setup and dependency installation
- **New Strategy**: Simplified to frontend-only deployment first

### Changes Made

#### 1. Simplified amplify.yml Configuration
- **Removed**: Complex backend build phase that was causing timeouts
- **Simplified**: Node.js setup to use runtime-versions only
- **Focused**: On successful frontend deployment first
- **Impact**: Should eliminate build cancellations

#### 2. Fixed Backend CLI Dependency Version
- **Issue**: Used non-existent version `^1.16.1`
- **Solution**: Corrected to `@aws-amplify/backend-cli@^1.8.0`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Verified and tested

#### 3. Streamlined Build Process
- **Removed**: Redundant NVM setup commands
- **Added**: Better logging and error handling
- **Optimized**: npm install with `--no-audit` for faster builds
- **Result**: Cleaner, more reliable build process

#### 2. Added TypeScript Support
- **Added**: `typescript@^5.7.2` to devDependencies
- **Added**: `tsconfig.json` for proper compilation
- **Impact**: Supports TypeScript backend files compilation

#### 3. Enhanced amplify.yml Configuration
- **Added**: Verification step for `ampx` command
- **Improved**: Better error handling in build process
- **Added**: Clear comments for each build step

#### 4. Added Helpful Scripts
```json
{
  "ampx:configure": "npx ampx configure",
  "ampx:deploy": "npx ampx pipeline-deploy",
  "ampx:sandbox": "npx ampx sandbox"
}
```

### Pre-deployment Checklist ‚úÖ

- [x] Simplified amplify.yml configuration
- [x] `@aws-amplify/backend-cli@^1.8.0` version corrected
- [x] TypeScript configuration added
- [x] Removed complex backend build phase
- [x] Frontend-focused deployment strategy
- [x] Documentation updated

### Current Strategy: Frontend First Approach

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy frontend successfully ‚úÖ (Current focus)
2. **Phase 2**: Set up backend separately after frontend works
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate backend deployment once frontend is stable

### Expected Build Process (Simplified)

```
1. Install Node.js 20 ‚úÖ
2. Run npm ci (faster, no audit) ‚úÖ
3. Build React app with Vite ‚úÖ
4. Deploy to Amplify CDN ‚úÖ
```

### Backend Deployment Plan

Once frontend deploys successfully:
1. Set up Amplify backend through Console
2. Configure authentication and data resources
3. Test backend integration locally
4. Add backend deployment back to amplify.yml
